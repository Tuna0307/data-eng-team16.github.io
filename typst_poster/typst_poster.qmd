# Introduction

The Singapore public-housing market has undergone pronounced shifts from 2020 to 2024, driven by demographic trends such as population ageing, household “rightsizing,” and policy changes like the rollout of the 2-Room Flexi Scheme. Our project builds on a Straits Times graphic (STRAITS TIMES GRAPHICS, 2025) that maps the **percentage change in HDB resale prices by flat type** over this period. Figure 1 illustrates the percentage change in resale prices by flat type—from 2020 to 2024—using data sourced from Data.gov.sg and Orangetee & Tie Research & Analytics. By comparing growth across 1‑room through Multi‑generation flats, this visualization highlights which segments have seen the strongest appreciation. We can build on this static snapshot by adding interactive filters, time-based x-axis and integrating transaction prices to deepen our insights into housing‑type–specific trends.


# Original Visualisation
![Original Visualization](images/original.png)

- Flat types: Seven categories from 1‑room up to Multi‑generation  
- Horizontal bars: Length proportional to percent change; 2‑room (45.4 %) and 3‑room (41 %) highlighted in blue as the highest‑growth segments  
- Baseline marker: Vertical zero line to distinguish growth from decline (although all segments appreciated)  
- Annotations: Exact percentages labelled at bar ends for quick value retrieval  
- Color scheme: Grey for most categories, blue for top two to draw attention  
- Source & Credits: Chart: STRAITS TIMES GRAPHICS • Source: DATA.GOV.SG, ORANGETEE & TIE RESEARCH & ANALYTICS  

# Critical Assessment of the Original Visualization

1. **Unordered Categories**  
   Flat types appear in an arbitrary sequence, forcing readers to search for the top and bottom performers rather than seeing them at a glance.

2. **Uniform Grey Bars**  
   Except for two blue bars, all categories share the same grey, making it hard to discern above- vs. below-average growth.

3. **Lack of Volume Context**  
   Percentage changes can be misleading when based on very few transactions (e.g. 1-Room). No indication of deal counts appears.

4. **Clipped & Inconsistent Labels**  
   Some annotations overlap the mean-line or the frame, and small-change bars carry labels that are too close to the axis cut-off.

5. **Static, Print-Focused**  
   No interactive features to reveal exact values, drill into regional breakdowns, or display uncertainty around medians.
   
## Weaknesses

1. *Lack of Temporal Granularity*  
   Aggregating from 2020–2024 hides year‑by‑year or quarter‑by‑quarter volatility.

2. *No Geographic Context*  
   Performance may vary by estate or region; this chart treats all transactions as homogeneous.

3. *Missing Transaction Volume*  
   Percentage change alone masks the underlying trade volume, which influences interpretation.

4. *Accessibility Concerns*  
   The blue/grey palette may challenge viewers with color‑vision deficiencies; no alternative encoding is provided.

5. *Bland Colors*  
   Only two color palettes being grey and blue which makes the graph look extremely bland.

# Suggested Improvements

- **Show Temporal Trends Directly**  
  Replace the static bar‐chart snapshot with a multi‑line chart of median resale price by flat type, so viewers can see year‑to‑year trajectories.

- **Endpoint Labeling**  
  Annotate each line at the 2024 end‑point with both the absolute median price and the total percent change since 2020, for immediate take‑aways.

- **Color‑Blind–Friendly Palette**  
  Use the Okabe–Ito (CUD) palette to ensure all seven flat‑type lines remain distinguishable to viewers with color‑vision deficiencies.

- **Currency Formatting**  
  Format the y‑axis tick labels as “\$300 K”, “\$400 K”, etc., to reinforce the S\$ scale and reduce cognitive load.

- **Interactive Hover Tooltips**  
  In a dashboard context, enable hover tooltips that display the exact median price and transaction volume for any flat type in any year.

- **Legend Placement & Sizing**  
  Move the legend below the chart, expand its marker size and line samples to improve readability in a poster format.

# Implementation for the Bar Graph

# Improved visualisation
![Improved Visualization](images/Improved Visualisation.png)
1. *Temporal Clarity*  
   Plotting x axis with years grants temporal granularity and insights to specific year.

2. *Endpoint Annotations*  
   At 2024, each line is labeled with its percent increase (e.g., “+47.8 %” for 3‑Room), eliminating the need for a separate legend lookup.

3. *Clean Axes & Gridlinese*  
   The y‑axis uses compact currency labels; gridlines are subtly drawn to guide the eye without clutter.


4. *Accessible Colors* 
    The enhanced plot is a multi‑line chart of **Median HDB Resale Price by Flat Type (2020–2024)**. Each of the seven lines uses a distinct CUD color:

- 1‑Room (Sky Blue)  
- 2‑Room (Vermilion)  
- 3‑Room (Bluish Green)  
- 4‑Room (Reddish Purple)  
- 5‑Room (Orange)  
- Executive (Yellow)  
- Multi‑Generation (Blue)

5. *Variety Colors*  
   Added a variety of color palettes to increase readability and improve visual appeal.

6. *Improved Legend*
   Positioned below, with enlarged line swatches and flat‑type names, making it easy to match colors to categories at a glance.
