Chosen Data Visualization\nWe selected the visualization from the Straits Times article: “Older buyers, smaller households among factors driving demand for smaller flats”\nThe featured chart depicts the percentage increase in HDB resale flat transactions from 2020 to 2024, categorized by flat type. Notably, it shows a 90.7% surge in transactions for 2-room flats, which strongly contrasts with more modest increases for 4-room and 5-room units. This visualization attributes these changes to several key demographic trends:\n\nA growing population of elderly citizens (aged 65 and above), many of whom seek to right-size their homes.\nA steady decline in average household size, falling from 3.5 persons in 2000 to approximately 2.9 in recent years.\nA rise in single-person and two-person households, particularly due to later marriages and aging-in-place.\nIncreased policy flexibility and supply of smaller flats, such as 2-room Flexi schemes, catering to senior citizens and singles.\n\nThis visualization is highly relevant for our project because it offers a clear example of how population ageing and evolving household structures directly influence public housing demand. By enhancing this static chart with dynamic and multi-dimensional data, we aim to uncover deeper patterns in demand across flat types, regions, and years. The outcome could help inform urban development policy and strategies for future housing allocation in Singapore’s maturing society.\n\nOriginal Visualisation 1\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Percentage Change in Number of HDB Transactions\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Visualisation 2\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Percentage Change in Resale Price of HDB flats\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Critical Analysis of the Original Visualization\n\nStrengths\n\nClarity and Simplicity: The bar chart effectively presents percentage change data in a manner that is straightforward and accessible, making it suitable for general readers without a technical background.\nEffective Comparison: By organizing the data by flat type, it allows readers to quickly identify which segments of the market are experiencing the fastest growth.\nContextual Relevance: The chart aligns well with the narrative in the article, which explores how social and demographic shifts are shaping the HDB resale landscape.\nClear Labeling: The use of bold titles and explicit labeling helps establish context immediately.\n\n\n\nWeaknesses\n\nLimited Granularity of Insights: The visualization presents an aggregated view of percentage changes across flat types over a four-year period, but it lacks finer granularity. It does not show:\n\nYear-on-year variation, which is critical for identifying short-term market shifts (e.g. policy impacts or economic shocks).\nTown-level or estate-specific data, which prevents detection of spatial patterns or localized demand pressures.\nDemographic segmentation (e.g. age groups, household size, income tiers), which limits the ability to assess how different population segments are influencing demand for smaller flats.\n\nLack of Interactivity and Customization: The static nature of the graphic restricts user engagement and exploration. Viewers are presented with a single, author-defined view of the data and cannot:\n\nFilter by specific years or towns.\nFocus on individual flat types or demographics.\nConduct self-guided analysis.\n\nMinimal Analytical Depth: The original chart is purely descriptive, presenting a one-dimensional summary of percentage change. It does not:\n\nShow base figures or total transaction volumes, making the percentage change potentially misleading.\nProvide contextual explanations (e.g. why 2-room demand increased, or how policy changes like Enhanced CPF Housing Grant may have influenced behavior).\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Planned Improvements\nTo overcome the limitations and offer a more robust and informative visual analysis, our team will develop an interactive dashboard incorporating the following enhancements:\n\nTime Series Visualization: Instead of one aggregated bar chart, we will plot monthly or quarterly transaction volumes from 2017 to 2025. This will reveal how demand evolved in relation to macroeconomic events, housing policies (e.g. cooling measures), and demographic changes.\nGeospatial Mapping: Using HDB town data, we will develop a Singapore map highlighting average resale prices and transaction volumes by region. This will help surface spatial disparities and allow for estate-level insights.\nInteractive Filters: The dashboard will include filters by flat type, town, and year. This will allow users (including policymakers or researchers) to explore patterns relevant to their context.\nCorrelation Visuals: Bubble charts or scatter plots will be used to examine relationships between floor area, resale price, and transaction volume. For example, we can test whether smaller flats in certain towns yield higher per-square-meter prices due to constrained supply.\nDemographic Overlay (if available): If demographic data by town is available, we will attempt to link population structure with housing demand to test assumptions about elderly and single buyers.\n\nOur final dashboard will offer clear, interactive, and multi-layered views that go beyond what a single static image can provide.\n\n\n4. Details of Data Source\nOur primary dataset will come from the HDB Resale Flat Prices repository on data.gov.sg, which offers a granular and authoritative view of public housing resale activity. Key features of this dataset include:\n\nTime Coverage: Monthly records from January 1990 through June 2025.\nAttributes:\n\nFlat type (e.g. 2-room, 3-room, 4-room, etc.)\nFlat model and floor area (in sqm)\nTown and block-level location\nMonth of transaction\nResale price (in SGD)\nStorey range (e.g. 04–06, 10–12)\n\n\nThe dataset is updated monthly and is widely used in public research, making it ideal for reproducible, policy-relevant visual analysis.\nAdditional contextual data will be sourced from SingStat for: - Population by age group - Household size and composition over time - Marital status and homeownership patterns\nTogether, these datasets will enable us to connect population dynamics to housing outcomes more rigorously.\nSample of Raw Data from HDB Resale Flat Prices (data.gov.sg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmonth\ntown\nflat_type\nblock\nstreet_name\nstorey_range\nfloor_area_sqm\nresale_price\n\n\n\n\n2024-01\nANG MO KIO\n2 ROOM\n406\nANG MO KIO AVE 10\n04 TO 06\n44\n315000\n\n\n2024-01\nANG MO KIO\n3 ROOM\n108\nANG MO KIO AVE 4\n01 TO 03\n67\n342000\n\n\n2024-01\nBEDOK\n4 ROOM\n516\nBEDOK NTH AVE 2\n07 TO 09\n92\n535000\n\n\n2024-01\nBUKIT MERAH\n5 ROOM\n108\nHENDERSON CRES\n10 TO 12\n117\n968000\n\n\n2024-01\nCLEMENTI\n3 ROOM\n377\nCLEMENTI AVE 5\n01 TO 03\n67\n365000\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Steps for Data Cleaning and Transformation\nTo prepare our data for rigorous analysis and visualization within the R environment, we will follow a structured workflow using core R packages, primarily from the tidyverse suite.\n\n5.1. Data Loading and Initial Inspection\n\nAction: The “Resale Flat Prices” dataset will be downloaded as a CSV file. We will load it into RStudio using the readr::read_csv() function to create a tibble (a modern data frame).\nPurpose: This initial step allows us to perform a preliminary assessment of the dataset’s structure using functions like glimpse(), summary(), and head() to understand its dimensions, variable types, and overall content before proceeding with cleaning.\n\n\n\n5.2. Missing Value Handling and Data Integrity\n\nAction: We will use the naniar or visdat package to visualize missing data patterns and dplyr::summarise() to quantify NA values in critical columns like resale_price, floor_area_sqm, and storey_range.\nPurpose: Identifying and addressing missing data is crucial for accurate modeling. For any NA values, we will evaluate the best strategy. If records with missing data are minimal, we may filter them out using na.omit() or tidyr::drop_na(). For more significant gaps, we will consider imputation, potentially using the median value for a given town and flat type to preserve the data’s distribution.\n\n\n\n5.3. Data Type Conversion\n\nAction: We will convert variable types to ensure they are appropriate for analysis. The month column (e.g., “2023-05”) will be parsed into a proper Date object using the lubridate::ym() function. Other columns like resale_price and floor_area_sqm will be ensured to be of numeric type using as.numeric().\nPurpose: Correct data types are essential for R functions to work correctly. Converting month to a Date object is critical for enabling time-series analysis, creating rolling averages, and plotting chronological trends.\n\n\n\n5.4. Feature Engineering\nUsing dplyr::mutate(), we will create several new, more informative variables:\n\nTemporal Features: We will use lubridate functions like year() and quarter() on our new Date column to extract the year and quarter, facilitating aggregation and trend analysis at different time scales.\nPrice per Square Metre (PSM): A new column, price_per_sqm, will be calculated by dividing resale_price by floor_area_sqm. This normalization is key to comparing property values fairly across different flat sizes and locations.\nStorey Level Conversion: The storey_range (e.g., “01 TO 03”) will be converted into a numeric variable. We will use stringr functions to extract the lower and upper bounds of the range and calculate the midpoint, allowing us to analyze the relationship between storey height and price.\n\n\n\n5.5. Data Aggregation and Integration\n\nAction: We will leverage dplyr::group_by() and dplyr::summarise() to aggregate the cleaned data. This will allow us to create summary tables based on dimensions like town, flat_type, and year.\nPurpose: Aggregated data is the foundation for our visualizations and high-level analysis. It will enable us to calculate key metrics such as mean/median price_per_sqm by town, which is necessary for creating choropleth maps, or by time period for generating time-series plots. If external demographic data is used, it will be joined to our main dataset using a dplyr::left_join() operation on a common key like town.\n\n\n\n\n6. Data Analysis Plan\nOur analysis will aim to provide evidence-backed insights on how demand for smaller flats has evolved in response to demographic shifts. The main areas of analysis include:\n\nDescriptive Statistics: Calculate averages, medians, and distribution patterns of resale prices and floor areas segmented by flat type and location.\nTrend Analysis:\n\nTrack year-on-year changes in both transaction volume and resale price for 2-room, 3-room, and larger flats.\nIdentify notable spikes or dips in relation to external factors.\n\nSpatial Analysis:\n\nMap average prices and volume by town to identify hotspots of demand.\nHighlight any regional inequalities in pricing or transaction growth.\n\nCorrelation Analysis:\n\nInvestigate links between demographic indicators and demand for smaller flats.\nTest if towns with higher aging populations see greater price growth in 2-room resale units.\n\nExploratory Insights:\n\nObserve whether price appreciation in smaller flats is outpacing larger units, potentially indicating shrinking supply or over-demand.\n\n\nThe outcome of our analysis will serve to validate, challenge, or deepen the conclusions drawn in the original news article.\n\n\n7.
